# Minecraft-server-handler
I made this for my own minecraft server for my friends, and I thought to share this on github!

## How to use

To start, open MCS handler.exe
(It will create a servers folder and a backups folder)

Add server files into the servers folder.
This was kind of my first java script I made.

## Extra info

You **MUST** close **ALL** servers before closing the application.

Servers are hotswappable, meaning that you can destroy or add servers while they are running.

You may edit this and use this all you want for all I care. If I cared about anyone using this it would not be up here

This entire system uses Swing, since I found it easier to add than

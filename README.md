# Minecraft-server-handler
I made this for my own minecraft server for my friends, and I thought to share this on github!

## How to use

### Installing Java

Go to `https://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp` and install Java.

**LINUX ONLY:** you can install java by typing `sudo apt install openjdk-21-jre`


### Windows


Open `MCS handler.exe` to launch the program (This also creates the servers and backups folder)
Add server files into the servers folder.

### Linux

Run `start.sh` with console to launch the program OR run `java -Xmx2G -jar "$(dirname "$0")main.jar"` in terminal  (This also creates the servers and backups folder)

Just like windows, add all server files in the servers folder

## Extra info

You **MUST** close **ALL** servers before closing the application.

Servers are hotswappable, meaning that you can destroy or add servers while they are running.

You may edit this and use this all you want for all I care. If I cared about anyone using this it would not be up here

This entire system uses Swing, since I found it easier to add than 

This was kind of my first java script I made. So expect it to be kinda bad.
